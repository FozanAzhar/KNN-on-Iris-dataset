# KNN-on-Iris-dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis and predictions made on Iris Dataset.<br>
- Model used: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)<br>
- A simple dataset to jump on data analysis and visualization and understand the working of KNN<br>
  among the plethora of Machine learning algorithms.

  ## KNN Classification Algorithm
1) Load the data<br>
2) Initialize K to your chosen number of neighbors.<br>
3) For getting the predicted class, iterate from 1 to total number of training data points<br>
a) Calculate the distance between test data and each row of training data. Use Euclidean distance as our distance metric
   since itâ€™s the most popular method.The other metrics that can be used are Manhattan, etc.<br>
b) Sort the calculated distances in ascending order based on distance values<br>
c) Get top K rows from the sorted array<br>
d) Get the most frequent class(mode) of these rows<br>
e) Return the predicted class<br>
